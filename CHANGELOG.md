# Changelog

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/tree/v0.1.0) (2024-01-31)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service/compare/v0.0.1...v0.1.0)

This is the first "proper" release (after v0.0.1).

It introduces several steps up compared to a bare-bones REST API service that started as a way to return the entities from the URI/URL they have defined. Specifically on the onto-ns.com domain under the `/meta` path.

The main upgrade revolves around the CLI, implemented to facilitate uploading entities.
It does so by connecting to the REST API service, authenticating via SINTEF's GitLab OAuth2 flow.

A PyPI release is not planned yet. To install this package run (in a virtual environment):

```console
pip install "entities-service[cli] @ git+https://github.com/SINTEF/entities-service.git"
```

Then run:

```console
entities-service --help
```

To learn more about the CLI.
